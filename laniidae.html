      <p>The family is composed of 34 species in two genera. The family name, and that of the larger genus, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for "butcher", and some shrikes are also known as butcherbirds because of the habit, particularly of males, of impaling prey onto plant spines within their territories. These larders have multiple functions, attracting females and serving as food stores. Most shrike species have a Eurasian and African distribution, with just two breeding in North America.
