        <p>Surviving in a difficult land</p>
      </header>
      <p>Thousands of years ago, the Paiute dug irrigation ditches that routed runoff from melting Sierra Nevada snows into the Owens valley. But unlike modern irrigation practices, the Paiute didn't channel the water onto farms or specific plots of land. They looked at everything as a garden. They practiced springtime, floodplain farming with reservoirs and irrigation ditches for corn, squash, melons, gourds, sunflowers, beans, and wheat. </p>
