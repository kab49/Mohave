intro: "Plants are gray-green with sparse foliage and are between 0.5-2 feet (15-50 cm) high. Basal leaves are 2 to 8 inches (5-20 cm) long and pinnate with narrow lobes while leaves further up the stem are smaller. Flower heads occur singly at the tip of branches. The flower heads are composed of strap-shaped ray flowers, growing longer toward the outer portion of the head, and collectively creating the appearance of a single flower as in other sunflower family plants."
