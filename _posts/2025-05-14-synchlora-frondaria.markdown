author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "This species and Synchlora frondaria are both small, bright green Emeralds, with narrow white antemedian and postmedian lines, a dorsal white stripe on the abdomen, and with little or no red on the wings. In S. aerata, the lines on the wings are fairly even, particularly on the forewing, and are usually only slightly dentate or waved, if at all. In S. frondaria, the lines are much more conspicuously dentate and there is a strong outward bulge in the postmedian of both wings located between M3 and Cu2 (some aerata show a slight offset in the postmedian on the hindwings but not on the forewings). Nemoria bifilata has a similar white abdominal stripe, but has a red terminal line that is absent in both of our Synchlora species. Larvae take on the colors of their host plant and employ decorative crypsis by attaching plant material to themselves."
