scientific: Eupeodes fumipennis
common: Western Aphideater
intro: The eggs of western aphideater are typically laid on foliage near aphid colonies, their primary food source during the larval stage. Once hatched, the larvae remain on plants, preying on aphids. Seeking the larvae involves inspecting under leaves and stems, specifically in gardens or fields with aphid infestations. Adult western aphideater are often found in flower-rich habitats such as meadows, gardens, and woodland edges, where they feed on nectar and pollen. Adults are typically black to metallic green with three yellow bands on the abdomen and a light yellow face with large black compound eyes.
