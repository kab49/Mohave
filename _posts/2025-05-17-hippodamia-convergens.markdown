scientific: Hippodamia convergens
common: Convergent Lady Beetle
intro: It is easily identified by the two white lines on its black thorax that converge towards each other. These beetles are collected from large aggregations in mountainous areas and sold for biological pest control, though their effectiveness in gardens can be limited due to their tendency to disperse.
life-cycle: Female H. convergens can lay over 1000 eggs over the span of a few months during the spring or early summer. In some populations, the beetles may undergo diapause if there are limited food resources to delay reproduction. Upon reaching the adult stage, females feed on fats and proteins for a week. This increases the production of juvenile hormone, helping the ovaries mature. This hormone also causes a behavior that results in long distance migration
size: 0.25 inch (4-7 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: none
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)




common-names: Convergent Lady Beetle
synonyms: Coccinella (Hippodamia) convergens, Coccinella modesta, Hippodamia juncta, Hippodamia convergens var. obsoleta, Hippodamia praticola
order: Coleoptera (Beetles)
family: Coccinellidae (Ladybugs or Ladybirds)
genus: 7 species in NV, 17 in CA, 19 in US
similar-taxa: 


distribution: North and Central America
flight: late spring and early summer
seen: Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve (3/31)
habitat: H. convergens tend to be more successful and more likely to survive to adulthood in warmer temperatures. In some areas, they gather on sunflower patches, having moved from wheat fields. They use the petioles of the sunflowers to hydrate, particularly in arid summer months. They populate grasslands, forests, agricultural fields, gardens, and national parks.
food: soft-bodied insects, with aphids being the primary food resource

 <p>In spring, after overwintering in large aggregations in the mountains, adults migrate to agricultural fields, grasslands, and other rural areas. This flight is for dispersal to find food (like aphids) and suitable places to lay their eggs. Flight activity and aerial density peak in the midsummer months. This is often when significant mating and egg-laying take place. As temperatures cool in the fall, there is a final dispersal event before the beetles seek out high-elevation, sheltered spots for overwintering.</p>
