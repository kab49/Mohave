scientific: Juriniopsis adusta
common: Bristly Flower Fly
intro: It is known for its larvae developing inside caterpillars and beetle larvae, making it a natural pest controller. These flies are also important pollinators, feeding on nectar from flowers like Rudbeckia laciniata. They have a hairy, spiky appearance, and can be red, black, brown, or orange, often with a pale green face.
life-cycle: The larvae are endoparasites, meaning they develop inside their host. Juriniopsis adusta plays a crucial role in controlling pest populations, particularly agricultural pests, by parasitizing caterpillars and beetle larvae.
