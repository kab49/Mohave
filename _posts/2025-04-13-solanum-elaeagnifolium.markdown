scientific: "Solanum elaeagnifolium"
common: "Silverleaf Nightshade"
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "The leaves are up to 15 cm long and 0.5 to 2.5 cm wide, with shallowly waved edges. Leaves and stems are covered with downy hairs (trichomes) that lie against and hide the surface, giving a silvery or grayish appearance. The flowers, appearing from April to August, have five petals united to form a star, ranging from blue to pale lavender or occasionally white; five yellow stamens and a pistil form a projecting center. The plant produces glossy yellow, orange, or red berries that last all winter and may turn brown as they dry. The lavender, star-shaped flowers with yellow centers are beautifully set off by the silvery foliage, and large patches of the plant in full bloom are striking. However, the plant is aggressive, poisonous, spreading steadily from deep rootstocks; in a few states it is classified as a noxious weed. It is very hard to control, as root stocks less than 1 cm long can regenerate into plants. The species is also toxic to livestock."
