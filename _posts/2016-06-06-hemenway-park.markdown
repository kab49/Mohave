  title: Repopulation
  excerpt: Since 1967, this herd has played a major role in the repopulation of the species throughout the state. Trapping and relocation is an important tool for maintaining healthy herd numbers and reestablishing herds in historic ranges. As a result of these location efforts NDOW has been able to increase sheep numbers in other areas of the state and helped other states do the same. The program has helped the states overall sheep population grow from less than 3,000 animals in 1967 to more than 12,000 sheep in 2021.

  title: Icons of the West
  excerpt: These majestic and social sheep, which can live into their late teens, very in body and horn size. The males are called "rams", the females are called "ewes". Adult rams may weigh between 140 to 200 pounds, while the ewes may weigh about 90 to 150 pounds. By age 6, rams horns are big and extremely curved. Horn size helps to establish rank in the herd, the larger the horns, the higher the rank.

  title: Facilities and Birds
  excerpt: As you can see from the picture, there is an adequate parking lot, playground, tennis courts, and covered picnic tables. The star of this park are the big horned sheep however there are a few trees and water so I expect some birds will be available if you come at the right time.
