 <p>Tribes throughout western North America
traditionally used different parts of the sulphur-flower
buckwheat plant to treat a variety of ailments. The
Klamath used a poultice of the leaves to soothe burns.
The Cheyenne made a tea from powdered stems and
flowers that was used as a gynecological aid for lengthy
menses. The Paiute and Shoshone made a poultice of
mashed leaves, and sometimes roots, to treat lameness or
rheumatism, and took a hot decoction of roots for colds or
stomachaches. The Kayenta Navajo used the plant as a
fumigant or to induce vomiting for gastrointestinal
ailments. The Kawaiisu used the mashed flowers as a
salve for gonorrheal sores.</p>
