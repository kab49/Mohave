intro: "Adults of the family Sarcophagidae do not feed exclusively on carrion, despite the weighty implications of the name flesh flies; in fact, adult flies are frequently discovered feeding on sweet substances, such as sap and flower nectar. The flesh-eating character of the family refers primarily to sarcophagid maggots, which feed predominantly on carrion, exposed meat, and excrement. Identification down to the species level in the family Sarcophagidae is notably difficult and relies primarily on the male genitalia. Though limited information is available regarding S. bullata, it has gained increasing recognition in the field of forensic entomology as a forensically relevant fly species, as it may be among the first species to colonize human remains. In these instances, recovered maggots may be analyzed for post-mortem interval (PMI) estimations, which may be used as evidence in courts of law."

common-names: Grey Flesh Fly
synonyms: Sarcophaga bullata, Sarcophaga bison, Neobellieria bullata
order: Diptera (Flies)
family: Sarcophagidae (Flesh Flies)
genus: 10-20 in NV, 25 in CA, 50 in US
similar-taxa: 
size: 0.3-0.6 inches (8-17 mm)
distribution: throughout North America
life cycle: Like all known sarcophagids, the species is larviparous, meaning that the egg develops internally and females then give birth to first-instar larvae. This must be accounted for when using the species in forensic work to calculate a post-mortem interval.
seen: Corn Creek
habitat: 
food: carrion, sap and flower nectar
