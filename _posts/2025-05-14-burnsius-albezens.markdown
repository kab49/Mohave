intro: "At present, Common and White Checkered-Skippers cannot be distinguished in the field. Checkered-Skippers nectar from small flowers, often choosing white-flowered composites. When they nectar, puddle, or perch, they usually hold their wings open. At night, they roost on tall weeds with wings tightly closed. This posture may give them a head start on sunlight absorption the following morning. Females lay eggs singly on the leaves of introduced and native members of the Mallow family. Larvae are believed to feed on plants in the mallow family, including globe mallows (Sphaeralcea), velvet-leaf (Abutilon), and poppy mallow (Callirhoe). Adults feed on the nectar of a variety of plants."
