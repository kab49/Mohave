scientific: Argia vivida
common: Vivid Dancer
intro: This species is the state insect of Nevada. Argia vivida vary in color, although they are typically associated with the bright blue coloration. Other variations include red, brown, or grey depending on the type of morph and temperature.
life-cycle: Upon mating, females lay their eggs on sources of vegetation just below the surface of the water.[6] Egg development requires cold temperatures of at least 11°C but can fluctuate from 0-33°C. In thermal springs, the life cycle takes approximately 1 year to complete, but may extend for up to 2 to 3 years in cooler springs. Argia vivida finally emerge as adults anytime between April through October depending on the current temperature.
size: 1.2 to 1.4 inches (29.5 to 35 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: Both male and female Argia vivida can change their body color based on temperature.
metamorphosis: incomplete (egg, nymph, adult)
