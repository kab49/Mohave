scientific: Xanthomelanodes arcuatus
common: Tachinid Fly
intro: is a species of parasitic fly belonging to the family Tachinidae. It is known to parasitize assassin bugs, specifically those in the genus Pselliopus, such as Pselliopus barberi and Pselliopus cinctus. The majority of female tachinids lay white, ovoid eggs with flat undersides onto the skin of the host insect. The free larvae immediately bore into the host's body. The compound eyes are brown. They do not meet at the top of the head in either sex. The antennae have three segments. The thorax has three segments. Each segment has four principal exoskeletal plates, one above, one below, and one on each side. The upper (dorsal) plates, from front to rear, are the prescutum, scutum, and scutellum. The prescutum is mostly black with broad, yellow lateral margins and a narrow yellow rear margin. The abdomen is mostly yellow with distinct black markings on the upper (dorsal) side of each segment. The last two segments are sometimes completely or almost completely black.
