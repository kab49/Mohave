author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "The plant often grows on vertical surfaces and hangs by its roots, which cling to cracks in rock. The stems are thick and very short, covered densely in rosettes of oval leaves. Both surfaces of the leaves are lightly covered in short fine hairs, which may not be obvious without close inspection. It produces many inflorescences which are spikelike clusters of flowers arising on erect peduncles up to 4 in (10 cm) tall. Each inflorescence is packed with flowers, each with five tiny white petals, many whiskery stamens, and usually 5 hairy pistils. The flower parts dry and may fall away, leaving a cluster of developing fruits, follicles containing the seeds."
