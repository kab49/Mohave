intro: "This is the Nevada sub-species, Ferocactus cylindraceus tortulispinus. It is usually cylindrical or spherical, usually found in clusters with some older specimens forming columns grow up to 50 cm (20 in) in diameter and 3 metres (9.8 ft) in height. The stem has 18 to 27 distinct ribs and is covered in long, plentiful spines, which are straight and red when new and become curved and gray as they age. Each areola typically contains four to seven central spines that are 5 to 15 cm (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, as well as 15 to 25 radial spines resembling strong hairs. The cactus bears funnel-shaped flowers that are maroon outside, and bright yellow inside, with red tints and yellow centers on the side that faces the sun, measuring 3 to 6 cm (1.2 to 2.4 in) in length and 4 to 6 cm (1.6 to 2.4 in) in diameter. The fleshy, hollow fruits are spherical, yellow, and about 3 cm (1.2 in) long."
