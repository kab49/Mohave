intro: "It is a perennial herb growing erect to a maximum height near 3 eet (1 m). The leaves are usually lance-shaped and sometimes folded lengthwise. They are arranged oppositely and often clasp the stem at the bases. The showy inflorescence bears tubular flowers with expanded mouths 1.5 in (3-4 cm) long. The flowers are light to deep blue, lavender, and purple, and usually have white throats. The white, generally hairless, throat helps to distinguish it from similar species within its range."
