scientific: "Gutierrezia sarothrae"
common: "Broom Snakeweed"
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "The leaves are alternate and up to 2 in (5 cm) long and thin. Glands on the leaves produce resin, making the leaves slightly sticky. The lower leaves are usually shed before the plant flowers. During its first year of growth, the plant produces a long, woody taproot, and numerous lateral roots as the plant matures. Numerous heads are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which is rounded and loose. The flower heads are small, with yellow ray flowers. The bracts are leathery, shiny, green-tipped. Gutierrezia microcephala and Gutierrezia sarothrae are quite similar, the most easily observed difference is in the flowers: G. microcephala has only one or two of both ray and disk flowers; G. sarothrae has three to seven ray and disk flowers."
