scientific: Strymon melinus
common: Gray Hairstreak
intro: The upper sides of the wings are gray with an orange spot on the hind margin. The underside of the wings are a lighter gray with white and black lines and orange and blue marginal spots near the hind-wings' tail-like extensions. These extensions twitch while at rest, and may imitate a separate head to encourage predators to go for the wings, potentially allowing the bug to survive.
