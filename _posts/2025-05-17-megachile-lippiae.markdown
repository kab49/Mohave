scientific: Megachile lippiae
common: Lippia Leafcutter Bee
intro: While most bees store pollen on their legs, Megachile lippiae carries it under its abdomen for easy access to a flower's pistil, where new seeds develop. Many plants on the Ash Meadow refuge depend on Megachile lippiae super-pollinator skills for their survival, including three plants, the Spring-loving Centaury, Ash Meadows Sunray and Ash Meadows lady's tresses.
life-cycle: It constructs nests in pre-existing cavities, such as rotting wood, hollow stems, or even holes in man-made objects. Females use their jaws to cut round pieces of leaves and petals to build their nests. They build individual cells for their offspring by lining them with leaf cuttings. Each cell receives a ball of pollen and nectar for the developing larvae. The mother bee controls the sex of her offspring by choosing whether to lay a fertilized (female) or unfertilized (male) egg.
