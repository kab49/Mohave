scientific: Ectemnius cephalotes
common: Large Ectemnius
intro: It is characterized by its black and yellow coloration and a large, square-shaped head. It is a solitary digger wasp that preys on flies and is not a threat to humans. They are considered beneficial due to their role in controlling fly populations and their potential contribution to pollination. Ectemnius cephalotes do not dig in sand but in soft wood instead. A nest may have one main entrance with several females using it. They bore lateral tunnels with separate cells capable of containing up to a dozen prey items apiece. The males, as usual, are smaller and play no part in breeding once mating has occurred.
size: 0.35-0.6 inch (9-15 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: yes, females often have more yellow on the thorax, particularly a yellow collar and scutellum, while males may have more extensive yellow markings on the underside of the abdomen. Males also have a distinctive feature of having knobbly antennae.
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)
