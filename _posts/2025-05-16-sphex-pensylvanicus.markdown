scientific: Sphex pensylvanicus
common: Great Black Wasp
intro: It is a large, solitary wasp known for its striking black color and iridescent wings. They are ground-nesting wasps, meaning they build their nests in the soil, unlike social wasps that form colonies. The body is satiny matte black. There is a narrow constriction between thorax and abdomen (it is a “thread-waisted” wasp). The wings are shiny, smoky black, with blue iridescence, usually folded together lengthwise down the back. The legs are long and spiny. The mandibles (mouthparts), usually held together and overlapping, are relatively large and sickle-shaped, with an extra prong in the middle of each curve. If you encounter a Great Black Wasp, remember that they are beneficial insects and are not likely to sting unless threatened.
