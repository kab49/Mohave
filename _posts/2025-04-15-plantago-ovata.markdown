intro: "Plantago ovata, commonly known as psyllium, is used as a source of soluble fiber and for various health benefits, particularly related to digestion and heart health. It's a natural laxative, helps manage cholesterol levels, and can aid in weight management by promoting satiety and reducing hunger. It is native to the Mediterranean region and naturalized in central, eastern, and south Asia and North America. According to Kew gardens, it is native to the southwest US and Baja California. Despite its weedy nature, Plantago ovata is cultivated for its seeds, which are a source of psyllium. Psyllium is a dietary fiber used in products like Metamucil and as a thickening agent in food."
