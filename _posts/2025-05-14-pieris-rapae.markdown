scientific: Pieris rapae
common: Cabbage White
intro: The butterfly is recognizable by its white color with small black dots on its wings, and it can be distinguished from P. brassicae by the latter's larger size and black band at the tip of the forewings. The upperside is creamy white with black tips on the forewings. Females also have two black spots in the center of the forewings. Its underwings are yellowish with black speckles. It is sometimes mistaken for a moth due to its plain appearance. Adults are diurnal and fly throughout the day, except for early morning and evening. Although there is occasional activity during the later part of the night, it ceases as dawn breaks.
life-cycle: The small white will readily lay eggs on both cultivated and wild members of the cabbage family. Caterpillars rest on the undersides of the leaves, making them less visible to predators.
