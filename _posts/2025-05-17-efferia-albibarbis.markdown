scientific: Efferia albibarbis
common: Sand Hammertail
intro: They are identifiable by their white "moustache" (mystax) and a unique, short, conical ovipositor in females, which helps distinguish them from other Efferia species. They generally appear elongated due to the conformation of the long tapering abdomen, however there are also compact species with broad abdomens. The integument is covered with thick hair, especially on the head and thorax and liveries are often showy, with colors ranging from brown to black to grey, sometimes in contrast with other colors such as red and yellow.
life-cycle: The name, robber flies, reflects their expert predatory habits, they feed mainly or exclusively on other insects and, as a rule, they wait in ambush and catch their prey in flight.
size: 0.39 to 0.59 inch (3-30 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: yes
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)
