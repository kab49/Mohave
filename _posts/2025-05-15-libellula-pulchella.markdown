scientific: Libellula pulchella
common: Twelve-spotted Skimmer
intro: It is a large showy dragonfly in the skimmer family, it looks even larger when flittering around the wetland because of the numerous spots placed along the length of the wing. Each wing has three brown spots. In adult males, additional white spots form between the brown ones and at the bases of the hindwings; it is sometimes called the ten-spot skimmer for the number of these white spots. Adults are most active in mid-summer, July & August, but can persist into September.
