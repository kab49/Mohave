sitemap: true
published: true


scientific: Pieris rapae
common: Cabbage White
intro: In appearance it looks like a smaller version of the large white (Pieris brassicae). The upperside is creamy white with black tips on the forewings. Females also have two black spots in the center of the forewings. Its underwings are yellowish with black speckles. It is sometimes mistaken for a moth due to its plain appearance.
life-cycle: The cabbage white butterfly is a pest because its caterpillars (cabbageworms) cause significant damage to plants in the Brassica family, such as cabbage, kale, broccoli, and cauliflower. While the adult butterflies are not harmful, the larvae chew large holes in the leaves, which can decimate crops and lead to financial losses for commercial farmers.

sexual-dimorphism: yes
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)
