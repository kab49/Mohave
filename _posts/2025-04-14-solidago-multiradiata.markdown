intro: "The stems vary in maximum length or erect height from 1-30” (3-80 cm). The leaves are linear or lance-shaped, sometimes narrowing quite a bit at the bases to become spoon- or spatula-shaped. They measure up to 8” (20 cm) long at the base of the plant, and are smaller farther up the stem. They are mostly hairless but may have hairs lining the toothed or serrated edges. The inflorescence is a cluster of several flower heads, with clusters containing up to 100 heads. Each flower head contains many yellow disc florets and many narrow yellow ray florets each 1/4” (3-4 mm) long."
