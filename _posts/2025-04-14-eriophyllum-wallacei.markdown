author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "It is a small, squat annual herb rarely more than 15 centimetres (6 inches) tall. The plant is covered in masses of white cotton-candy-like wool and has small oval leaves up to 2 cm (1 in) long. Between March and June it produces one flower head per stem, about 6 millimetres (1⁄4 in) wide and each with 5–10 yellow or cream-colored ray florets. The rays are about 3 mm (1⁄8 in) long and sometimes have red veins, surrounding 20–30 yellow disc florets. The seed is black and narrow. In drier conditions, the plant tends to grow a single stem to ensure its reproduction via seed. With more moisture, it branches from the base into multiple stalks."
