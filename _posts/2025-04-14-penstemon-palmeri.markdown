intro: "It typically has leaves that are oblong to triangular, with the upper leaves clasping the stem. These leaves are generally opposite, meaning they grow in pairs along the stem, and they can have toothed or wavy margins. The leaves are also fleshy and can be a grayish-green colo The inflorescence is a panicle or raceme with small bracts. The flower has a five-lobed calyx of sepals and a cylindrical corolla which may have an expanded throat. The staminode is partially hairy. The showy, rounded flower has large pink to violet to blue-purple petals and is fragrant, which distinguishes it from other, similar-looking penstemon."
