intro: "A favorite of many gardeners is firecracker penstemon (Penstemon eatonii), so named for its bright red flowers that gently dangle along one side of its purple stems. The leaves are lance-shaped to oval, untoothed, and up to 9 centimeters in length. It has both cauline and basal leaves, those that are attached to the stems and ones that grow directly from the base of the plant, which are very deep green and glossy. Each inflorescence has four to twelve groups of flowers with a pair of opposite bracts underneath where they attach. It is especially attractive to hummingbirds. This penstemon is widely adapted to elevations from 3,000 feet up to 10,000 feet."
