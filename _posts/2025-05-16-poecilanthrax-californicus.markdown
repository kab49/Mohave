scientific: Poecilanthrax californicus
common: Bee Fly
intro: Poecilanthrax species often mimic bees, which is a form of Batesian mimicry. They have features that resemble bees, such as a hairy body and coloration patterns, but they lack stingers. The larvae of Poecilanthrax species are parasitoids, meaning they live on or in another organism (the host) and consume it. Specifically, Poecilanthrax larvae often parasitize the larvae of other insects, such as beetles or caterpillars.
