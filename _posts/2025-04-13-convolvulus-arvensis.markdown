intro: "Field bindweed is a noxious and invasive weed in 35 US states, primarily in the midwest and west. It's considered one of the world's worst weeds due to its abundance, economic impact, and wide distribution. It is a perennial vine that dies back each year. Its twisted stems are often found growing on other upright plants. Its white to pink flowers start to appear in May. White-pink, trumpet-shaped flowers open each morning and close each afternoon. The plant reproduces both from seed and creeping roots, with seeds remaining dormant in the soil for up to 60 years. Field bindweed possesses both a deep tap root and shallow horizontal lateral roots (University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources 2003). A single plant is able to spread outward more than 10 feet (3 m) in one growing season."
