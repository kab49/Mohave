scientific: Phidippus californicus
common: California Jumping Spider
intro: Base colors are black and white, with potential red or orange highlights on the abdomen, which can change with molting. Spiderlings emerge from the egg sac and initially remain in the nest for about three weeks before their first molt. As they grow, they shed their exoskeleton (molt) multiple times. Each molt allows them to increase in size and develop more adult-like features.

sexual-dimorphism: males smsller
metamorphosis: incomplete (egg, spiderling, adult)
