scientific: "Stanleya pinnata"

author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "The stems are unbranched, hairless, often waxy in texture, and have woody bases. The leaves have fleshy blades up to 0.5 in (15 cm) long by 0.25 in (5 cm) wide which are divided into several long, narrow lobes. The blades are borne on petioles. The top of the stem is occupied by a long inflorescence which is a dense raceme of many flowers. Each flower has four narrow yellowish sepals which open to reveal four bright yellow petals each up to 1 in (2 cm) long. The stamens protruding from the flower’s center may approach 1 in (3 cm) in length. Some of the plant’s amino acids use selenium from the soil in place of sulfur, making it highly toxic to animals."
