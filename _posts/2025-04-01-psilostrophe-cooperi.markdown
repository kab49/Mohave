author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "The stems rise from a woody base to form that a nearly spherical form. It is a low, spreading bush with pale green, hairy foliage. It is drought deciduous, dropping its leaves in times of drought. The linear leaves are alternate. The daisylike flower heads have 3 to 8 deeply toothed golden-yellow ray florets. The flower heads are often bunched together at the tops of the stems in a rounded spray. The ray flowers persist for a time and then dry and become papery while maintaining their yellow color. The 3 toothed corollas of the dried ray flowers fold back over the phyllaries."
