scientific: "Rumex hymenosepalus"
common: "Canaigre Dock"
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "A very large set of basal leaves are produced in the spring from distinctly tuberous roots and short rhizomes. The plant sends up a stout, conspicuous flower stalk covered with tiny pinkish-red flowers, which are followed by showy reddish-brown seeds. It has been cultivated in the southwestern United States for the roots, a good source of tannin, which is used in leather tanning. It also yields a warm, medium brown dye. The leaves and leaf stalks are considered edible when young, the older leaf stalks cooked and eaten like rhubarb, which is in the same plant family. It contains oxalic acid, so consumption should be in moderation."
