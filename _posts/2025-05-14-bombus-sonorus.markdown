scientific: Bombus sonorus
common: Sonoran Bumble Bee
intro: The female is recognized by having the thoracic hairs yellow on the pronotum, anterior portion of scutum, and scutellum resulting in a black band between the base of the wings. Additionally, the first three abdominal segments (T1-T3) are entirely yellow. Males are similar, but have T1-T4 yellow. The shade of yellow is deep golden color.These bumblebees generally nest underground, often in old pocket gopher burrows.
life-cycle: The cycle begins with a queen bumblebee emerging from hibernation in the spring, founding a new colony, and laying eggs. These eggs develop through larval and pupal stages within the nest, eventually emerging as worker bees. Later in the season, the queen produces male and new queen offspring, which mate before the old colony dies off. The new queens then hibernate through the winter, restarting the cycle the following spring.
