intro: "You can spot Nevada jointfir (Ephedra nevadensis) along the desert flats while green Mormon tea (Ephedra viridis) can be found in Red Rockâ€™s canyons and higher elevations. Both plants have spreading branches that resemble green straws and have very tiny scale leaves. Nevada jointfir tends to be a gray-green while green Mormon tea has more of a bright yellow-green color. It is woody below, topped with many dense clusters of erect bright green twigs. They may yellow somewhat with age. Nodes along the twigs are marked by the tiny pairs of vestigial leaves, which start out reddish but soon dry to brown or black. The stems are green and photosynthetic. Male plants produce pollen cones at the nodes, each under a centimeter long with protruding yellowish sporangiophores. Female plants produce seed cones which are slightly larger and contain two seeds each."
