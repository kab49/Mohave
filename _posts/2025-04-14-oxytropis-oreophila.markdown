scientific: "Oxytropis oreophila"
common: "Mountain Locoweed"
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "Plants are small, especially in alpine regions, and lack stems; leaves and flower stalks grow directly from the base. Stalks, leaves and calyces have a covering of relatively long, silvery hairs. Leaflets are folded up along the leaf axis. Flowers are produced in compact clusters of between two and 12. Corollas are purple/pink to nearly white, darker when withered. Clusters may rise a little way above the leaves, or be held within. Flowers are conspicuous though small, around half an inch long. Fruits are short, inflated, hairy, egg-shaped pods, around half an inch long, angled upwards when mature."
