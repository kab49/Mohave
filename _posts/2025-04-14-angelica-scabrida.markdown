intro: "A narrow endemic of the Spring Mountains in Clark County, Nevada. Known from about 11 locations. Threatened by loss of occurrences due to development and alteration of its spring and riparian habitat including: recreational use of riparian areas, competition from exotic species, wild horse and burro trampling, and spring diversions. The leaves are compound (odd-1-pinnate), to about 15 inches; deltoid; margin serrate with small spines on the tips of each point. Flowers are compound umbels, flowers white (sometimes pink, red, purple)."
