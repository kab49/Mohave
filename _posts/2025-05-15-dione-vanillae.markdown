scientific: Dione vanillae
common: Gulf Fritillary
intro: In its adult form, the gulf fritillary is a medium-sized butterfly that has extended forewings. This butterfly exhibits sexual dimorphism as females are typically distinctively larger in size than males. The underside of the wings is brown and speckled with silvery white dots. In contrast, the top surface layer of the wings is deep orange in color with black streaks running across. In addition to the size difference between the two sexes, females are usually darker in color and are more marked with black streaks as compared to the males.
life-cycle: The role of host plants is also integral to the oviposition of gulf fritillaries, as the female butterflies lay their eggs on or near the host plant Passiflora (Passion Vines).
