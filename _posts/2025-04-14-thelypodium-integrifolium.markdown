intro: "Thelypodium integrifolium is a biennial herb producing a hairless, waxy stem with a thick, sturdy base, unbranched or branching toward the top and sometimes becoming quite tall, approaching three meters in maximum height. The thick, waxy leaves are not compound or lobed, having smooth edges. The largest basal leaves may exceed 30 centimeters in length. Leaves higher on the plant are shorter and are smooth-edged or toothed. The inflorescence is a dense, cylindrical, spikelike raceme of white or purplish flowers. The fruit is a silique which may be 8 centimeters long."
