intro: "The perennial silver-stem lupine bears from one to several, occasionally branched stems, each 1-2 ft. tall and covered with hairs. Stalked, palmately-compound, silvery-green leaves line the stems. Violet, pea-like flowers are arranged in a showy spike, up to 8‚Äù long, atop the stems. The flowers of silver-stem lupine are sometimes pink and rarely white. This species spreads quickly to form colonies. There are five varieties."
