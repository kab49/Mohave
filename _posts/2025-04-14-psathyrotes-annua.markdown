intro: "It is a low, flat or mounding plant with spreading, hairy, scaly stems. It is pale green to reddish purple in color with gray-green leaves, its color dull from the coating of fibers on its surface. The irregularly rounded leaf blades are up to 1.6 centimeters long with wavy or toothed edges. The knobby inflorescence arises from the leaf axils. It is lined with hairy gray-green phyllaries with dull points that curve outward. It contains several hairy yellow to reddish disc florets. The fruit is an achene covered densely in long hairs and tipped with a large pappus of bristles. The plants are low, densely branching, hairy, and scaly, with a turpentine-like odor. Leaves are alternate and hairy. The Latin name of the genus (from the Greek psathurotes) refers to the brittleness of the stems."
