intro: "It is a species of bee fly in the family Bombyliidae. It is found in Canada from the Yukon east to Ontario, and across most of the United States from Massachusetts west to California and Texas, but is absent from the southeast. Its larvae are predators of grasshopper eggs. The females seek grasshopper egg-pods which the maggot devours. A component of a healthy ecological web, the gray bee fly is a beneficial insect for farmers and gardeners. They are known for their resemblance to bees and their rapid, buzzing flight."
