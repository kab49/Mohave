title:  "Long-tailed Duck"
scientific: "Clangula hyemalis"
intro: "The Long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis), formerly known as the oldsquaw, is a medium-sized sea duck that breeds in the tundra and taiga regions of the arctic and winters along the northern coastlines of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It is the only member of the genus Clangula. Adults have white underparts, though the rest of the plumage goes through a complex moulting process. The male has a long pointed tail and a dark grey bill crossed by a pink band. In winter, the male has a dark cheek patch on a mainly white head and neck, a dark breast and mostly white body. In summer, the male is dark on the head, neck and back with a white cheek patch. The female has a brown back and a relatively short pointed tail. In winter, the female's head and neck are white with a dark crown. In summer, the head is dark. Juveniles resemble adult females in autumn plumage, though with a lighter, less distinct cheek patch."

  title: Habitat
  excerpt: The long-tailed duck spends most of the year (approximately nine months) primarily in coastal marine waters. Only during the breeding season does it frequent shallow wetlands of low-lying tundra, ranging southward to the northern edge of the boreal forest. Non-breeding and molting birds tend to use deeper ponds and lakes and nearshore marine areas.

  title: Food
  excerpt: The long-tailed duck is gregarious, forming large flocks in winter and during migration. They feed by diving for mollusks, crustaceans and some small fish. Although they usually feed close to the surface, they are capable of diving to depths of 60 m (200 ft). They use their wings, like velvet scoters, to dive, which gives them the ability to dive much deeper than other ducks.

  title: Nesting
  excerpt: Their breeding habitat is in tundra pools and marshes, but also along sea coasts and in large mountain lakes in the North Atlantic region, Alaska, northern Canada, northern Europe, and Russia. The nest is located on the ground near water; it is built using vegetation and lined with down. They are migratory and winter along the eastern and western coasts of North America, on the Great Lakes, coastal northern Europe and Asia, with stragglers to the Black Sea.

  title: Migration
  excerpt: Long-tailed ducks breed on tundra across northern Eurasia (in Russian Siberia, Kamchatka, and Karelia, for example), the Faroe Islands, Finland, parts of southern Greenland, Iceland, Norway, as well as across northern North America (Alaska and northern Canada). In winter, they are found on and near large bodies of seawater, such as the Northern Pacific Ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean, Hudson Bay and the American Great Lakes. Small numbers are found on the Missouri rive.
