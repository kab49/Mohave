intro: "It is a spreading plant, reaching a maximum of 10 feet (3.2 m) in height. It is deciduous, bearing rounded or spade-shaped often toothed green leaves. These fall in autumn. In mid-spring the shrub blooms short inflorescences of white flowers, each with five widely spaced, 1-cm-long, narrow petals. The flowers of Utah serviceberry have white petals and grow in small clusters. In early spring, while in bloom, the entire plant is snowy white. The fruits are 1-cm-long purplish pomes. The core mountainous range of the species is delimited by the Colorado–New Mexico–Wyoming Rocky Mountains. This widedspread shrub serves as browse for Mule Deer, Desert Bighorn Sheep, and domestic livestock; its berries are eaten by birds such as the Sage Grouse."

 <p>Utah serviceberry has been used for fuel to a very limited degree. The fruit, both fresh and dried, was extensively used as food by Indians. The branches were used for making bows.</p>
