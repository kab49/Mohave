scientific: Vanessa annabella
common: West Coast Lady
intro: Aside from general differences in distribution, V. annabella can be distinguished from the other two painted ladies of North America as follows Most conspicuously, it lacks obvious ventral eyespots on the hindwings; there are two large ones on V. virginiensis and four small ones on V. cardui. Like the latter, it also lacks a white dot in the pinkish-orange subapical field of the ventral and dorsal forewings. Its upperwing coloration has the purest orange of the three; the American painted lady is usually quite reddish.
life-cycle: The developmental stages of Vanessa annabella can be divided into eight different stages first instar larva, second instar larva, third instar larva, fourth instar larva, fifth instar larva, prepupa, pupa, and adult.
size: 1.5-2.25 inches (3.8 to 5.7 cm)
sexual-dimorphism: In their adult stage, there is subtle sexual dimorphism between males and females, as females have a more rounded hindwing compared to their male counterparts.
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)
