title:  "Oreochrysum parryi"
scientific: "Oreochrysum parryi"
common: "Parri’s Goldenrod"
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "It spreads from underground roots putting up scores of clusters of basal leaves, each leaf about three to five inches long. Plant stems, typically from twelve to eighteen inches tall, are characteristically rough with a purple hue and sport few but large, clasping and vertical, then arching leaves. Flower heads are small relative to the size of the plant and typically three to six flower heads are clustered at the top of the plant; there may be a number of clusters. The large leafy bracts below the flower head are key in identifying this species and in distinguishing it from Solidagos."
