title:  "Floyd Lamb Park"
scientific: "Best in North Las Vegas"
intro: "Floyd Lamb Park at Tule Springs is a 2,040-acre park in Las Vegas, Nevada. The park is centered on Tule Springs, a series of small lakes that formed an oasis in this part of the Mojave Desert. One of the larger urban retreats in the Las Vegas Valley, Tule Springs was once considered to be far out of town but is now circled by development. The park includes the Tule Springs Ranch, Tule Springs Archaeological Site, Tule Springs Wash and four ponds available for fishing. Given the presence of water and riparian habitats, Floyd Lamb Park and the surrounding areas are a magnet for birds, animals and insects of all kinds. The combination of Corn Creek at the Desert Wildlife Preservation Refuge and Floyd Lamb Park at Tule Springs forms the birding hub for people in the Northwest part of Las Vegas. This is balanced by the opposite birding hub of the Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve, the Wetlands Park, the Las Vegas Wash and Sunset Park in the southeast of Las Vegas."

Migrants such as Yellow-breasted Chat, MacGillivray’s Warbler, and Cassin’s Vireo pass through in spring and fall. Birders us the picnic table numbers to locate hotspots in the park.

  title: Memorial Grove
  excerpt: Approximately 15 years ago, a memorial tree grove was begun in Floyd Lamb Park, south of Mulberry Lake and east of Willow Lake, to serve as a place where families of murder victims could plant trees in memory of loved ones. The Pinegrove can be a good area for birding, especially in fall winter and spring.

  title: Tule Springs Ranch
  excerpt: The first establishment at Tule Springs may have been the U.S. Hotel owned by a Mr. Levandowski (around 1905). In 1916 a Mormon settler, Bert Nay, filed for water rights on the site. Nay sold the ranch to Gilbert Hefner in 1928, who owned the property until 1941 when he sold it to Sheriff Gene Ward, who in turn sold it to Prosper Jacob Goumond. Most of the buildings on the ranch date from the 1940s, when Goumond was developing the Tule Springs Ranch into a “divorce ranch.” The Water Tower is one of the most prominent buildings in the historic area of the Park. It is the tallest structure and one of the first constructed during Goumond’s ownership of the ranch.

  title: The Park Core
  excerpt: This beautiful place is home to 680 acres of a gorgeous park filled with lush vegetation, beautiful views of the lake, mountain ranges in the distance, and loads of birds and other wildlife for you to enjoy and appreciate.

The Park Core includes recreation facilities, the historic Tule Springs Ranch, and two private equestrian facilities, operated by one equestrian company, which lease land for stables, fenced training areas, and offices.

  title: Tule Springs Lake
  excerpt: Frequently referred to as Tule Springs or Tule Springs Pond, this stocked fishing pond is one of a series of four ponds. These ponds were constructed on the site of a historic pond and marsh complex that was used by Native Americans for thousands of years before the recent settlement of southern Nevada.

  title: Mulberry Lake
  excerpt: There are four lakes at the park that are stocked for fishing. Tule Springs Lake is the largest of the lakes in the park followed by, Mulberry Lake, then Cottonwood Lake, and then Desert Willow Lake. There are a nice collection of both domestic and wild geese and ducks at most times of the year. The collection of birds is much like that of Sunset Park with cormorants, geese and ducks during all but the hottest times of summer.

  title: Memorial Grove
  excerpt: The memorial tree grove has been maintained by State Parks staff and by the families. An obelisk near a sitting area designates the location and significance of the tree grove. Small plaques near the planted trees recognize the names of the deceased. When the Park is transfered into city ownership, the memorial tree grove will continue to be maintained by the City of Las Vegas.
