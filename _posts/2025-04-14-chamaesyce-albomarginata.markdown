intro: "It can be easily identified by its small size, dusty green leaves, very flattened growth pattern, and the white circular margin around the edge of its burgundy centered flowers. The flower has a circular burgundy center with a white ring around it. The epithet albomarginata (white-margined) refers to the white ringed margin of the flower petals. The plant actually has no petals, but has modified leaves called bracts, more round that the green leaves on the rest of the plant, which form a cuplike shape. The 12â€“30 male flowers are difficult to see, consisting only of one stamen each, and are clustered in the center of the cup. The single female flower is at the center, with an elevated ovary pendant on a long stalk, which when fertilized and mature, bears a capsule fruit. The leaves are round to heart shaped with the point of the heart away (ovoid) from the small stem attaching the leaf to the branch (petiole). The nonflower leaves are a peculiar dusty green, with green but sometimes with burgundyish edges, and redish stems and particularly so after a late Spring or Summer rain. As with other typical members of the Euphorbia family, it has a white milky sap, and is poisonous."
