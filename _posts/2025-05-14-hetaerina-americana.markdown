scientific: Hetaerina americana
common: American Rubyspot
intro: A medium-sized damselfly with a distinctive red-spot at the base of otherwise clear to smoky-colored wings and a red thorax (as males) with an iridescent gold-green abdomen. The distinctive red spots on the wings of male American Rubyspots continually increases in size throughout the life of an individual. These larger spots apparently lead to more success at holding a territory. However, these same individuals are apparently less successful at hunting. The eyes are brownish. The female is more greenish than red. The thorax and abdomen is green with white markings like the male. The wings of the female have amber spots at the base and along the leading edge of wings. The wings also have tiny white stigmas (near tips of wings). The abdomen is stockier than the male.
