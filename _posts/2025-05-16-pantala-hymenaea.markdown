scientific: Pantala hymenaea
common: Spot-winged Glider
intro: It is a robust species with a cylindrical abdomen and broad hindwings. The eyes are red and the face is also red in breeding males. The general body color is brown, and females and immatures have a diagonal white marking on the thorax. There is a small dark brown spot at the base of the hindwings which distinguishes this species from the otherwise similar Wandering Glider (Pantala flavescens).
life-cycle: The species likely breeds in all occupied territory, with the exception of British Columbia and Manitoba, where it is probably a vagrant. Breeding takes place in temporary wetlands, flooded areas, pools and garden ponds. The most important factor for successful breeding is likely the absence of fish, as the nymphs feed in the open.
