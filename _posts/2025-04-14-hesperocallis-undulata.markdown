scientific: "Hesperocallis undulata"
common: "Desert Lilly"
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "It has deep seated, tunicated bulbs, glaucous leaves and straight stout stems. Glaucous leaves are characterized by a bluish-grey or whitish waxy coating that gives them a frosted or powdery appearance. This coating is often easily rubbed off and is a reflection of the sun's rays, preventing excessive water loss and overheating in the plant. Flowers are large, white with a silver or green midstripe and are fragrant, especially at night. Height range: to about 60 cm. Found in sandy flats of creosote brush desert scrub in some of the most arid regions of North America (deserts of southeastern California, Baja California and Sonora, Mexico, and southwesten Arizona), it flowers only after infrequent rains."
