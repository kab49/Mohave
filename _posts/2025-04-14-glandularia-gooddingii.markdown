intro: "Both the stems and deeply divided, three-lobed leave are quite hairy. It is a spreading plant forming a low mat 3 ft. wide. The plant blooms in large, dense, head-like spikes of many flowers atop several 6-18 inch stems. Each flower has a calyx of hairy sepals and a pale purple-blue corolla up to 1/2 inches (1.4 cm) long. It is common to see these in the mountains in the weeks following rain."
