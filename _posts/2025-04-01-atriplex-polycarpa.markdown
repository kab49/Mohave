scientific: "Atriplex polycarpa"
common: "Cattle Saltbush"
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "A desert shrub with interesting texture. A favorite food of desert tortoises. This is an Atriplex with tiny leaf rosettes alternatively spaced along the woody stem. It can be difficult to establish but once in place is drought tolerant. It can develop galls due to infestation by gall midges like Asphondylia floccosa. Specifically, the larvae of A. floccosa, also known as the woolly stem gall midge, induce galls on the stems of Atriplex polycarpa. These galls are characterized by their woolly appearance and can contain multiple chambers."
