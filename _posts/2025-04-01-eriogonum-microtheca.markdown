intro: "This is a shrub which is quite variable in appearance. There are many varieties, some of which are isolated to small geographical distributions. It may be a low clumping plant or a sprawling shrub to 4 ft (1.5 m) in height and width. Scraggly, woody perennial with a few, leafy stems and a much-branched inflorescence with tiny, terminal flower clusters. Leaves alternate, linear to oblong or narrowly obovate, 0.5-1.5 inch (1-3 cm) long, narrowed gradually to a short petiole, gray-woolly beneath and greenish but with some hairs above, crowded along the lower half of the stem. The upper portion of the plant makes up its inflorescence, which often has a flat top. The tiny clustered flowers are white to yellow or sometimes pinkish."
