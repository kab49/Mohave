scientific: Argia funebris
common: Springwater Dancer
intro: The Springwater Dancer can be distinguished from similar species like the Vivid Dancer by its central range and the specific pattern of its thoracic stripes. Males are typically bright blue with black markings, while females are a pale brownish or bluish color. The springwater dancer has a black stripe along the side of its thorax. The male is typically blue, but some can be violet. Honestly, this looks exactly like the Vivid Dancer (Argia vivida), the oly real difference seems to be location.
