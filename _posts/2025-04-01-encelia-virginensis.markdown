common: "Virgin River Brittlebush"
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "It is a bushy, sprawling shrub reaching heights between 100 and 150 cm (40-60 inches). It has many branches, with the younger parts hairy and the older stems developing a thickened bark. The gray-green, fuzzy to hairy foliage may be sparse, appearing pale because of the presence of many small hairs on the surface. On top of many erect, hairy stems are solitary daisy-like flower heads with 11 to 21 ray florets which are generally yellow, and a center of yellow disc florets. The fruit is a dark brown achene 5 to 8 millimeters long and usually lacking a pappus. Virgin River brittlebush is distinguished from other Encelia species by its smaller mature plant size and smaller leaves, and the presence of both ray and disk flowers."
