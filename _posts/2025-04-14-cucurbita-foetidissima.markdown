scientific: "Cucurbita foetidissima"
common: "Buffalo Gourd"
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "Triangular, as long as 12 inches, growing along long, prostrate stems. Compare with Cucurbita palmata leaves, palmate with five long triangular points. The large, bell-like flowers, 2-4 inches long, are yellow to orange, 5-lobed at the opening, with stamens that have large anthers deep inside the throat. The fruit is consumed by both humans and animals. The fresh young gourd can be eaten like squash. The mature fruit is no longer edible, due to bitter compounds. Seeds may be eaten after being prepared by roasting or boiling."
