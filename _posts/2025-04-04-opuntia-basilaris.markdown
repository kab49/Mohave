intro: "It is a medium to small-sized prickly pear cactus, with pink to rose colored flowers. A single plant may consist of hundreds of fleshy, flattened pads. These are more or less blue-gray, depending on variety. They are typically spineless, but as is typical for Opuntia species, have many small barbed bristles, called glochids, that easily penetrate the skin. Opuntia basilaris blooms from spring to early summer. The species is variable in nature and several names under different ranks have been described. Only four of these are generally accepted."
