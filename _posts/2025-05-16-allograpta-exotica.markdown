scientific: Allograpta exotica
common: Exotic Streaktail
intro: Face with dark brown to black medial stripe, two narrow parallel yellow strips and two broader oval sublateral yellow markings on the 4th and 5th terga. They are very similar to Allograpta oblique but have black katepimeron and black anterior anepisternum rather than yellow. Hoverflies possess a labellum, which is a soft, sponge-like structure at the end of their proboscis (a straw-like mouthpart). This labellum has tiny channels that allow it to soak up liquid and spread pollen. Also hoverflies have only a single pair of wings compared to two sets for bees.
size: 0.3 inches (6-7 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: yes Males holoptic (eyes touching dorsally)
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult) Their life cycle from egg to adults is around 15 days, with adults living for approximately 10 days.



common-names: Exotic Streaktail
synonyms: Allograpta fracta, Syrphus exoticus
order: Diptera (Flies)
family: Syrphidae (Hoverflies)
genus: 2 species in NV, 2 in CA, 2 in US
similar-taxa: Allograpta oblique


distribution: World-wide distribution. In the US, mostly in southwest, TX and Mexico
seen: Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve
habitat: larva are found in decaying organic matter and larva have the unusual ability to swim vigorously, adults croplands, old fields, grasslands, and even suburban areas with orchards
food: Larvae are important natural enemies of common agricultural pests such as aphids. Adults are flower visitors and are important pollinators in natural ecosystems and agricultural crops. While they primarily feed on nectar and pollen, hoverflies can also utilize other liquid food sources like honeydew (a sugary substance produced by aphids) and even sweat.
