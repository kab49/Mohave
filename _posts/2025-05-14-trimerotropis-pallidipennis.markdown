scientific: Trimerotropis pallidipennis
common: Pallid-winged Grasshopper
intro: They are more active during the summer months, and their pale, mottled coloration makes them hard to see against surfaces such as the granite often found in the gravel of dry river beds. The behavior of the pallid-winged grasshopper is apparently determined by temperature, with foraging occurring at temperatures of 24–32 °C (75–90 °F) and mating at 30–40 °C (86–104 °F).
life-cycle: The Pallid-winged Grasshopper overwinters in the egg stage. Nymphs begin appearing in late April. Adults generally occur from early June to October. This species is known to make dispersal and migratory flights to other areas and regions, some of them quite distant. It has been reported to occur mostly in June and July.
