intro: "Nicotiana glauca is a small tree or shrub with many branches that normally grows to over 6 feet (2 m), but can reach as high as 20 feet (7 m). Its leaves are thick and rubbery and can be up to 20 cm long. It has yellow tubular flowers about 5 cm long and 1 cm wide. The plant primarily reproduces by seed. Tree tobacco is native to South America but it is now widespread as an introduced species on other continents. It is a common roadside weed in the southwestern United States, and an invasive plant species in California native plant habitats."
