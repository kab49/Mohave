scientific: Papilio machaon bairdii
common: Baird's Swallowtail
intro: The Baird's Swallowtail has a yellow abdomen with black stripes, and its wings feature black markings with yellow spots and long tails. The orange eyespot on the hindwing has an off-center, oblong black pupil that touches the inner margin. P. bairdii is very close to the Oregon Swallowtail, and blends into it on the north (near the north borders of California and Nevada), making drawing a line between the two very difficult to do. However, Oregon Swallowtails are much more yellow.
life-cycle: Caterpillars feed on Artemisia (sagebrush) and sometimes on other plants like fennel, rue, and carrot. There are usually two to three broods in a year.
size: 2 1/2 - 3 inches (6.5 - 7.5 cm)
sexual-dimorphism: no 
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)
