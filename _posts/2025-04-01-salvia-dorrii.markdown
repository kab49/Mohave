intro: "It is a woody subshrub reaching 10–70 cm (4–28 in) in height and width. The grey-green leaves are narrow and lanceolate, are tapered at the base and rounded at the tip generally without teeth or lobes. They are generally basal, and 1–3 cm (3⁄8–1+1⁄8 in) long. They have an intense but pleasant, mildly intoxicating minty aroma, with the scent released when the foliage is handled or crushed. The inflorescence is made up of spike-like clusters of numerous purple flowers that are bilaterally symmetric."

 <p>It is this sage, not sagebrush, that is referred to in Zane Grey's classic Western, Riders of the Purple Sage. It is a handsome plant, pretty in leaf as well as in flower.</p>
