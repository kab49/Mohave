scientific: Mydas ventralis
common: Mydas Fly
intro: It is a Batesian mimic of scoliid wasps, meaning it resembles a dangerous or unpalatable species to gain protection. It is a large size, with a black body, mostly red abdomen, and smoky wings. The tip of the abdomen is black. although they look fearsome, they are harmless and have no stinger.
life-cycle: Males have been observed perching on shrubs, waiting to chase passing females, and have even been known to chase passing scoliid wasps. These flies are often found in areas where nectar-producing flowers, such as milkweed, are blooming, as male Mydas flies may gather there to await females for mating.
size: 1-1.25 inch (25-30 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: 
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)




common-names: Mydas Fly
synonyms: Midas rufiventris Loew, 1866, Midas ventralis Gerst√§cker, 1868, Mydas abdominalis Adams, 1904
order: Diptera (Flies)
family: Mydidae (Mydas Flies)
genus: 1 species in NV, 1 in CA, 50 in US
similar-taxa: scoliid wasps


distribution: Mydas ventralis is found in locations such as the lower Colorado River region, and as a member of the Mydidae family, it is part of a group predominantly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas globally, with significant presence in the dry regions of the North American Southwest.
flight: Their presence is linked to the availability of these floral resources, which generally occurs during the spring and summer months in regions where they are found, such as the southwestern United States. For example, observations in Arizona suggest they are present when desert milkweed blooms.
