title:  "Cooper's Hawk"
scientific: "Accipiter-cooperii"
intro: "Cooper's hawk (Astur cooperii) is a medium-sized hawk native to the North American continent and found from southern Canada to Mexico. This species was formerly placed in the genus Accipiter. As in many birds of prey, the male is smaller than the female. The birds found east of the Mississippi River tend to be larger on average than the birds found to the west. It is easily confused with the smaller but similar sharp-shinned hawk(Accipiter striatus)."

  title: Habitat
  excerpt: Cooper’s Hawks are forest and woodland birds. These hawks are a regular sight in parks, quiet neighborhoods, over fields, at backyard feeders, and even along busy streets if there are trees around. They are also adaptable in all seasons to forested mountainous regions, especially foothills.

  title: Food
  excerpt: Often smallish or medium-sized birds are the preferred food, but also many small mammals and, in more arid vicinities, lizards are regularly taken. Infrequently, frogs may be eaten, as will (rarely) insects and fish in nearly dry watercourse. Birds in general form about 50–85% of diet.

  title: Nesting
  excerpt: Cooper's hawk is a solitary bird apart from breeding and rare aggregations during migration. Usually a bulky platform nest is built each year although pairs may reuse a nest for 2-3 years. Egg laying peaks in late April although it can occur as early as Febuary. Often about 3–5 eggs are laid every other day, though there can be up to 2 days between the 4th and 5th eggs. Jeveniles depart the nest at about 1 month.

  title: Migration
  excerpt: Cooper's hawks are year-round residents around Las Vegas and in most of the Mohave. Like a majority of diurnal birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere, Cooper's hawk is a partial migrant. They tend to be most migratory in the north and largely to partially sedentary elsewhere.

  title: Adult Cooper's Hawk
  excerpt: Adults have blue-gray upperparts and white underparts with rufous barring. Their tails have a series of alternating dark- and light-gray bands and a white tip. Adults also have dark crowns that contrast with their lighter-colored napes, and have yellow irises that darken with age, first to orange, and then to red in older adults.

<p>
Two distinct plumages: adult and juvenile. Adults have blue-gray upperparts and white underparts with rufous barring. Their tails have a series of alternating dark- and light-gray bands and a white tip. Adults also have dark crowns that contrast with their lighter-colored napes, and have yellow irises that darken with age, first to orange, and then to red in older adults. Juveniles have brown upperparts, and cream-colored underparts with reddish-brown streaks on their breast and belly. Females are as much as one third larger than males overall, and individuals from western North America generally are smaller than eastern birds. Overall, the hawk is a larger version of the Sharp-shinned Hawk, and separating these two species in the field can be difficult.</p>
