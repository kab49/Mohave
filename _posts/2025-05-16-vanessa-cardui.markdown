scientific: Vanessa cardui
common: Painted Lady
intro: It is a medium-sized, migratory butterfly known for its distinctive orange, black, and white patterned wings and its worldwide distribution across continents except South America and Antarctica. It is a common visitor to gardens and open areas, feeding on nectar from various flowers and fruit. Orange-brown with black markings and white spots on the forewings. The hindwings have a row of small black spots. The underside is mottled with gray, brown, and black, featuring four small eyespots near the edge of the hindwing.
life-cycle: The butterfly's life cycle includes a spiny caterpillar stage that feeds on host plants like thistles before transforming into a chrysalis and emerging as an adult.  Painted Ladies are migratory, with populations moving north from deserts in Mexico and the southwestern U.S. to colonize other parts of North America annually. The adult lifespan is 14-28 days.
size: 2-3 inches (5-9 cm)
sexual-dimorphism: females are generally slightly larger and possess a rounder, broader abdomen, while males have thinner, straighter abdomens and a structure called claspers at the end of their bodies which are absent in females
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)




common-names: Painted Lady
synonyms: Papilio cardui Linnaeus, 1758
order: Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths)
family: Pieridae (Whites and Sulfers)
genus: nk species in NV, nk in CA, 2 in US
similar-taxa: American lady (Vanessa virginiensis), West Coast lady (Vanessa annabella)


distribution: It is one of the most widespread of all butterflies, found on every continent except Antarctica and South America.
flight: In many northern areas, Painted Ladies arrive from the south in late spring or early summer, starting around March or May. Butterflies are active and reproduce during summer, with local populations developing. A southern migration occurs from late summer into fall, with large numbers sometimes seen. They breed during this southward journey, unlike some other migrating butterflies.
seen: Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve
habitat: open areas such as fields, prairies, gardens, and vacant lots

 <p>Painted Lady butterflies undertake one of the world's longest continuous migrations, covering thousands of miles over multiple generations to reach their destinations, like the Sahel Desert and the Arctic Circle. They fly at high altitudes, up to 22,000 feet, and can reach speeds of 30 mph while riding favorable winds. Their flight is an "irruptive" migration, meaning large numbers can appear in surprising locations, often driven by environmental factors. Sometimes, due to wet conditions in desert areas like the US-Mexico border, there can be a massive "butterfly boom," leading to large numbers migrating north into areas like Southern California and British Columbia.</p>
