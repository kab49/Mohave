title: "Ambrosia salsola"
scientific: "Ambrosia salsola"
common: Burrobush
author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "It has thin stems and narrow, needlelike leaves. Leaves are narrow and needlelike (linear), thread-like (filiform), sometimes up to 65 mm (2.6 in) long but a mere 1.5 mm (0.059 in) across. The foliage and stem tips have a foul, pungent, cheese-like scent when crushed, a trait which gives the plant the common name cheesebush. This species, notable for its foul smell, easily hybridizes with the white bur-sage (Ambrosia dumosa)."
