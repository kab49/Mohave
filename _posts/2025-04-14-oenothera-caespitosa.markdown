intro: "Tufted evening-primrose is a low-growing stemless perennial with gray-green fuzzy leaves and wonderful 3-4 inch fragrant white flowers that open in the evening and close in the mid-day heat. It has no stems, with flowers and leaves growing directly from the root crown. The four-petaled white flowers open at dusk and wilt the next morning, turning pink. It grows throughout the West in sunny, dry, infertile, rocky, well-drained soils."
