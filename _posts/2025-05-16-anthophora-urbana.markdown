common: Urbane Digger Bee
intro: This is a native bee, smaller than a honey bee, that nests in the ground and transports pollen on its hind legs. These solitary bees are black with gray hairs, including gray bands around the abdomen. They are known for nesting in the soil, often in aggregations in bare, flat ground or vertical banks. Urbane digger bees are active from May to October, with peak activity from June to September. These bees fly so fast, you often only see a grey streak zoom by.
