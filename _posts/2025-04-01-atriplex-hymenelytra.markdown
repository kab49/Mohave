intro: "It is silvery-whitish-gray shrub in the family Amaranthaceae, native to deserts of the southwestern United States. It is the most drought tolerant saltbush in North America. It can tolerate the hottest and driest sites in Death Valley, and remains active most of the year. It is generally a compact, rounded bush, covered in distinctive reflective silver-gray, twisted, oblong, many-pointed leaves. It drops its leaves drought deciduous in extreme drought conditions. It tolerates alkaline soil, salt and sand. The leaves accumulate salts which helps extract water from the soil when other plants cannot. Salt is shed by dropping the leaves."
