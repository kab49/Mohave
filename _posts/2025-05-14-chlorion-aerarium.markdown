description: Steel-blue Cricket Hunter Wasp (Chlorion aerarium)
sitemap: true
published: true


scientific: Chlorion aerarium
common: Steel-blue Cricket Hunter Wasp
intro: The Steel Blue Cricket Hunter is so named because the solitary females hunt crickets of the family Gryllidae as prey. Once she locates one, she stings it into weak paralysis and flies it or carries it to a simple burrow she excavated previously. She sometimes chooses to dig her own burrow from inside the entrance of a cicada killer burrow, oddly enough. The burrow may terminate in more than one cell (multicellular burrows may even be the norm). The female places several crickets in each cell, closing the cell with a plug of soil between forays. A single egg is laid on one of the victims. The larva that hatches then consumes the cache of crickets. 
life-cycle: 
size: 0.75-1 inch (20-25 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: yes but subtle, males tend to be brighter in color and larger
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)



common-names: 
synonyms: Sphex nearcticus
order: Hymenoptera (Bees, Wasps, Ants)
family: Sphecidae (Thread-waisted Wasps)
genus: 1 species in NV, 2 in CA, 20 worldwide
similar-taxa: Blue Mud Dauber (Chalybion californicum)


distribution: 
seen: Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve
habitat: commonly found where their prey, crickets, and potential nest sites (like cicada killer burrows) are present
food: Both genders fuel their frenetic activity mostly on fermenting plant sap oozing from wounded shrubs, such as oozing Desert Broom plants (Baccharis sarothroides). Only rarely does this wasp visit flowers for nectar.
