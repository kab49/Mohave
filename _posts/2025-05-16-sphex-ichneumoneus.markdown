scientific: Sphex ichneumoneus
common: Great Golden Digger Wasp
intro: It is identified by the golden pubescence on its head and thorax, its reddish orange legs, and partly reddish orange body. Short, golden hair covers their black head and thorax. The rear segment of the abdomen is black, and the front abdomen and legs are reddish-orange. Great golden digger wasps are solitary, so you will not likely see more than one of them at a time. And although they display bright colors as if to warn predators off, these wasps do not exhibit aggressive behavior.
