scientific: Brachygastra mellifica
common: Mexican Honey Wasp
intro: It is one of few wasp species that produces honey. It is also considered a delicacy in some cultures in Mexico. This wasp species is of use to humans because it can be used to control pest species and to pollinate avocados. Workers and males share the same coloration. They both have alternating abdominal bands of yellow and black. Queens characteristically have a dark reddish-brown abdominal coloration. Queens can also be distinguished from workers due to the occurrence of sperm in the spermathecae of the queens.
life-cycle: Adult Mexican honey wasps can be observed foraging for food, often attracted to sweet substances like fruit or sugar water. They play a crucial role in the colony, with multiple queens potentially present in larger nests. The colony is maintained year-round, with honey production and storage for feeding the entire colony, including through the winter.
size: 0.25-0.35 inches (7-9 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: yes, females have stingers
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)

seen: Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve
habitat: 
food: Brachygastra mellifica is very good at searching and feeding on Diaphorina citri in tree flushes, an introduced species that has become one of their major prey items. These wasps feed not only on the fluids from the prey, but may also eat the entire exoskeleton of D. citri. They also may consume larvae of the weevil Anthonomus aeneoulus and a moth from the family Alucitidae.
