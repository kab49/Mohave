scientific: Argia moesta
common: Powdered Dancer
intro: Males have a blue tip at the end of the abdomen. Immature (freshly moulted, or teneral) males are tan to dark brown, turning darker with age and becoming almost completely whitish (pruinose) at maturity.â€Š Females come in blue and brown forms based on the color of the thorax, which has hair thin dark shoulder stripes. The blue form female is very similar to the female blue-fronted dancer; a key to separating these two is the number of cells below the stigma our species has two cells below the stigma where a blue-fronted dancer has one.
life-cycle: They live up to four weeks and become sexually mature at two weeks. Mating pairs tend to aggregate in a givenarea, and individual pairs will spend up to an hour and a half exploring for a place to mate, and then spend between 30 to 60 minutes mating. Females deposit their eggs on the surface of the water or will descend up to several feet below the surface of the water for up to 30 minutes to deposit their eggs in on plants.
