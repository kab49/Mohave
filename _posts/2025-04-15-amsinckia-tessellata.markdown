author: Kurt Buzard
intro: "It produces small yellow flowers, on a stem which gradually unfurls - mostly straight but coiled at the top - and all green parts of the plant are covered by long, thick, bristly hairs, irritating to the touch. The tubular flowers open to five lobes, often with small orange patches around the inside of the corolla tube. The green calyx underneath has 2 to 4 lobes, fused below the middle, separated by whitish bands. The leaves and stems are covered with bristly to finely appressed hairs. The flowers are tubular with 5 lobes. Flowers are yellow-orange and larger 7 to 12 mm long and exserted from the calyx. Bristly fiddleneck is most accurately separated from Menziesâ€™ fiddleneck by the presence of two or more fused calyx lobes giving the appearance of 2 to 4 sepals compared to five in the other species.
