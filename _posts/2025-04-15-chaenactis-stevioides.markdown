intro: "According to Flora of North America, it is among the most abundant spring wildflowers in the higher Mojave Desert and southern Great Basin. The stems are hairy with cobwebby fibers which thin with age. The leaves are pinnately divided into many subdivided lobes. The plant blooms from March to June. The inflorescence bears several flower heads on a tall peduncle. Each head is lined with rigid, hairy and glandular phyllaries and filled with white, pink, or pale yellow disk flowers, the ones in the middle smaller and somewhat tubular, and the ones nearer to the edge larger and open-faced, resembling ray florets. The fruit is a hairy achene with a pappus of four scales."
