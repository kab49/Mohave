scientific: Ischnura ramburii
common: Rambur's Forktail
intro: Males are green with blue on abdominal segments 8 and 9. Females are orange-red, olive green, or similar to males in coloration. Males have green eyes with black caps, and tiny blue spots behind their eyes of the top of their head. Their thorax is bright green below and dark metallic green top.
life-cycle: They mate on the ground, on grasses, and the stems of plants. The male grabs the female by the back of the head with the end of their abdomen and the female curls her abdomen forward to form a heart-like shape. They mate from two to seven hours. Eggs are deposited in the late afternoon on floating leaves and stems.
