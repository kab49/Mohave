scientific: Palpada alhambra
common: Single-banded Plushback
intro: In a Single-banded Plushback (Palpada alhambra), the dorsal and ventral bands are typically aligned or offset by a small amount. In a Double-banded Plushback (Palpada agrorum), the dorsal and ventral bands are offset significantly, appearing to alternate or be positioned opposite each other. When viewing this fly from the top or bottom, it is almost exactly the same as the Double-banded Plushback. The other major factor in the identification of this particular hoverfly, is the distribution. The Double-banded Plushback is found over both north and South America, and very common in the eastern United States. The Single-banded Plushback is found in California, Nevada, and Arizona. This species is characterized by its orange-yellow body with narrow, dark bands on the abdomen and three encircling yellow bands. The thorax is covered with a black metallic shield on the upper side with white to gray hair, and the rest is covered with orange-yellow hair.
size: 0.25-0.5 inch (7-12 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: yes but subtle banding differences on the abdomen.
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)



common-names: Single-banded Plushback
synonyms: Eristalis alhambra
order: Diptera (Flies)
family: Syrphidae (Hoverflies)
genus: 11 species in NV, 11 in CA, 11 in US, 85 world
similar-taxa: Double-banded Plushback (Palpada agrorum)


distribution: California, Nevada, and Arizona
seen: Clark County Wetlands
habitat: gardens, meadows, woodlands, and other areas with abundant flowering plants. The larvae, on the other hand, are often found in damp or aquatic environments with decaying organic matter.
food: Hoverflies get their names from the ability to remain nearly motionless while in flight. The adults are also known as flower flies for they are commonly found around and on flowers, from which they get both energy-giving nectar and protein-rich pollen. The larvae are aquatic filter feeders of the rat-tailed type. They are called rat-tailed maggots because they have a thin, respiratory (breathing) appendage (anal spiracles) at the rear that can be up to several times the length of the body.
