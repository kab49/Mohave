 <p>Lycium andersonii (Wolfberry or Manzanita) and Lycium fremontii (Fremont's Wolfberry) are both native plants in the southwestern United States, but they differ in some key ways. L. andersonii has smaller, usually narrower leaves, while L. fremontii has larger, bright green, spatulate leaves. L. fremontii also tends to have more glandular pubescence (hairy) on its leaves and stems. Additionally, L. fremontii flowers are generally dark purple and erect, while L. andersonii flowers are often smaller and may be slightly purplish. L. fremontii fruits are tomato-like, while L. andersonii berries are bitter.</p>
