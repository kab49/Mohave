intro: "The knobby green stems are fleshy and appear jointed at the internodes between segments. Often the segments are so short they are nearly round. The leaves appear as flaky scales scattered across the surface of the stems. When flowering the abundant small flowers appear yellow with pollen that is shed into the wind. There are no showy petals."
