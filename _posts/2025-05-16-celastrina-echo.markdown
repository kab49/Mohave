scientific: Celastrina echo
common: Echo Azure
intro: The taxonomic division of Celastrina butterflies has been a very complicated issue. The butterflies in the Lycaenidae family in general are usually flat as larvae. The adult individuals are usually small and have hairy, ringed antenna-like tails. Their wings are mostly bright glowing blue and green. A large portion of Lycaenidae butterflies are found to have different associations with ants, either mutualistic, parasitic, or predatory.
life-cycle: C. echo in particular is usually pale blue-grey with small black spots or dashes. Based on the limited observations reported and the life history records of the other blue butterflies (Polyommatini), C. echo's known life history starts with eggs laid on the flower buds of its host plants. Attended and protected by the ants, C. echo's larvae feed on the flower buds and flowers while ants receive sugar-rich honeydew from them throughout the larval lifespan. C. echo then may pupate within ant nests.
size: 0.75-1.25 inches (19â€“32 mm)
sexual-dimorphism: Males are a bright, solid blue on the upper side with no black markings, while females are a more muted, dusky blue that often includes a broad black band along the outer edge of the forewings and a row of gray or black spots on the hindwings.
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)




common-names: echo azure or western azure
synonyms: 
order: Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths)
family: Lycaenidae (Gossamer-winged Butterflies)
genus: nk species in NV, nk in CA, 2 in US
similar-taxa: 5 sub-species


distribution: western regions of the United States
flight: may fly in 1-2 or more broods from early spring to the fall (around February to late June, July, or even till October if there is no severe cold weather)
seen: Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve
habitat: woodlands, shrublands, and near mountain streams, places that have woody host plants they feed on
food: The C. echo larval foodplants are mainly composed of Ceanothus (California wild lilac), Spiraea (Holodiscus), Aesculus (California buckeye), Rubus (blackberries), and some legumes. The adults' host plants are also very diverse. They mostly feed on nectar from plants including the larval host plants listed above, Heteromeles (toyon), Rhamnus, and several others.
