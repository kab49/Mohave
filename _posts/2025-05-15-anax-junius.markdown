scientific: Anax junius
common: Green Darner
intro: The common green darner (Anax junius) is a large, brightly colored dragonfly with a 3.5–4 in wingspan and a 2.6–3 in abdomen. It's known for its iridescent green head and thorax, and a distinctive bullseye-like marking on its head. Males have black abdomens with bright blue markings, while females have duller, brownish-orange abdomens. Green darners are native to North America and are one of the most common and abundant dragonfly species there.
life-cycle: The dragonflies mate in flight. The eggs are deposited in water or close by. The larvae (nymphs or naiads) are generally slender compared to those of other families, with a long and flat extensible lower lip (labium). The larvae are aquatic predators, feeding on other insects and even small fish.
size: 3.5 inch (7.5 cm)
sexual-dimorphism: yes, males have a bright blue abdomen, while females typically have a reddish-brown or green abdomen
metamorphosis: incomplete (egg, nymph, adult)
