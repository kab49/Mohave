scientific: Steniolia longirostra
common: Sand Wasp
intro: Steniolia wasps are solitary ground nesters, meaning they dig individual burrows in sandy areas to raise their young. They are often found near areas with loose, sandy soil. It constructs burrows for its young, and provisions them with paralyzed prey. Females work constantly, during the active part of the day they are either digging new burrows, checking old burrows, hunting prey or bringing prey to burrows. They fly in short bursts with much hovering and zipping about in short flights. Their buzzing sound constantly varies as they zip about in short flights. It has a yellow and black color pattern. The genus Steniolia is within the larger family Bembicidae and contains about 15 described species.
