scientific: Stelis laticincta
common: Wide-striped Painted-dark Bee
intro: It is characterized by its black or dark metallic coloration, often with wide, contrasting yellow stripes (hence the name wide-striped). It is a species of cuckoo bee, meaning it's a parasitic bee that lays its eggs in the nests of other bees. Specifically, S. laticincta is known to be a cleptoparasite of resin bees in Megachile angelarum and other Megachile species, meaning it steals the pollen and nectar provisions that the host bee has collected.
