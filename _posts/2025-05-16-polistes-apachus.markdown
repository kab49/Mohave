scientific: Polistes apachus
common: Apache Wasp
intro: The antennae are entirely a dull orange-brown. The clypeus (mouth part) is practically flat when viewed from the sides. On the thorax, the pronotum has a thin yellow border, and its metanotum has two transverse yellow stripes. The anterior (front) stripe is narrow and the posterior (back) stripe is broader. There are two longitudinal yellow stripes on the mesoscutum, however some males do not have these stripes. The abdomen has alternating stripes of golden brown and yellow. There are two prominent yellow spots/patches positioned opposite each other slightly to the sides of the middle (sub-lateral) of the second tergite (a segment of the exoskeleton on the back) of the metasoma, and usually smaller and less obvious spots on the first, third and subsequent tergites. The metasoma of the male has a tubercle in the middle of the seventh sternite
life-cycle: Nests can grow to be large by the end of the season, containing about 150 cells.
size: 0.8 inch (2 cm) P. apachus is the largest and most brightly-colored Polistes in the state of California, which helps with differentiate it from similar species.
sexual-dimorphism: 
metamorphosis: complete (egg, larva, pupa, adult)
