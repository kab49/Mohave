title:  "Nothern Harrier"
scientific: "Buteo lineatus"
intro: "The Red-shouldered Hawk is named for its reddish upper wing coverts, or shoulders. The lineatus in its name means striped in Latin, referring to its black-and-white-banded tail and finely barred reddish breast. Another distinctive field mark: translucent wing crescents, or windows, near the base of the wingtips, visible when the bird soars or glides overhead. This attractive raptor is smaller and slimmer than the more widespread Red-tailed Hawk, almost resembling an accipiter such as the Cooper's Hawk. The male and female red-shouldered hawk have similar plumage, but the female is noticeably larger than the male. There are 5 subspecies, the range of B.I. elegans is southern Oregan to Baja California."

  title: Habitat
  excerpt: Red-shouldered hawks are forest raptors. In the east, they live in bottomland hardwood stands, flooded deciduous swamps, and upland mixed deciduous–conifer forests. They tend to live in stands with an open subcanopy, which makes hunting easier. They are not exclusively birds of deep forest, though; one can find red-shouldered hawks in some suburban areas where houses or other buildings are mixed into woodlands. In the west, they live in riparian and oak woodlands, and also in eucalyptus groves and some residential areas.

  title: Food
  excerpt: Red-shouldered Hawks prefer to hunt from a perch in the forest understory; they also fly low through the forest, pouncing on prey in a stealthy surprise attack. Aquatic and semi-aquatic animals, particularly frogs, small fish, snakes, and crayfish, are mainstays of the Red-shouldered diet, but the birds will also catch lizards, rodents, smaller birds, and large insects.

  title: Nesting
  excerpt: They are also noisy while courting. During one courtship display, a pair soars in broad circles while giving a series of three to four screaming kee-aah calls. Males also vocalize during a solo display, circling high into the air, then descending in a steep dive, followed by a rapid, spiraling ascent. After mating, both birds of a pair build a large stick nest, which they often reuse from year to year. Red-shouldered hawks only have one brood per season and usually lay two to five eggs. Both parents aggressively defend the nest and incubate the eggs. The female broods the chicks during their nestling stage, while the male brings food to the nest. Both parents feed the young after they fledge.

  title: Migration
  excerpt: In the East, individuals from the northern half of the species’ range are migratory. In the West, most populations are sedentary. Birds in central and southern states don't tend to migrate, although some Red-shouldered Hawks do spend winters in Mexico. Birds on the West Coast are mostly nonmigratory.
