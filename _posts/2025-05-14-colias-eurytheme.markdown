scientific: Colias eurytheme
common: Orange Sulphur
intro: The orange sulphur is medium-sized with a wingspan of about 5 cm (2 in). Though color may vary among individuals, the wings are typically yellowish and orange, although some females are white and may appear greenish. The top (dorsal) wing surface has dark brown to black edging.
life-cycle: Unlike that of many other butterfly species, the courtship of C. eurytheme is very brief and does not involve many elaborate displays. Females preferentially mate with males whose wings reflect ultraviolet light.
size: 2 inches (5 cm)
sexual-dimorphism: yes, subtle. Male C. eurytheme hindwings demonstrate an ultraviolet reflectance pattern while female C. eurytheme hindwings demonstrate ultraviolet absorbing patterns.
