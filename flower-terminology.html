      <p>Flowers are made up of four basic parts: the pistil, stamens, sepals, and petals. The eye-catching color of flowers usually comes from the sepals and petals. In some flowers, like the indian paintbrush to the right, these two parts can be hard to tell apart. The sepals are leaf-like, usually connected at the very base of the flower. They may be green or brightly colored, depending on the plant species. Sepals surround the flower bud, protecting it as it develops. Once the flower opens, the petals are visible. These ore often brightly colored, leaf-like parts attract pollinators. Some even have ultraviolet markings to direct pollinators to the nectar. Three pieces make up the female pistil. A sticky stigma catches pollen. A stalk-like style holds the stigma up in the air. The ovary sits inside the flower at the base of the style. The male reproductive structures are made up of two parts: the anther and the filament. The anther produces pollen (the male sex cell) to pass a half-copy of its genetic code on to its offspring. The filament holds the anther in place to help spread the pollen to the pistil. Most flowers have more than one stamen.</p>
