			<p>Mojave Nature is a site devoted to the plants, animals, places and history of the Mojave Desert, the smallest of the four major deserts in North America. It is nestled between the Great Basin on the north, the Sierra Nevada and San Bernadino mountains on the west, the Colorado Plateau and Arizona Mountain Forests east, and on the south by the Sonoran Desert. One-quarter of the plant species of the Mojave Desert are found nowhere else. Between the sky islands and unique riparian oases there places for everyone. Sit back and enjoy your visit.
